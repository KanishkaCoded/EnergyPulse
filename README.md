A Foundation Model Approach to Building Load Forecasting and Anomaly Detection
AUTHOR NAME: Kanishka
Problem Statement
Buildings are responsible for roughly one-third of global energy consumption and emissions. Efficient energy use in residential and commercial spaces is a key step toward reducing environmental impact. However, unpredictable load patterns and external variables such as weather, occupancy, and operational schedules complicate short-term energy forecasting.
This project addresses the challenge of accurately forecasting short-term energy consumption and detecting anomalies in building usage data. The goal is to enable smarter energy management systems that can adapt to changing patterns, support renewable energy integration, and reduce dependency on fossil fuels.
